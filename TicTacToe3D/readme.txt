Release notes:
--------------
This game was initially developed for MIX 10k Challenge and the objective
was to fit the source into 10kb and not the nice architecture or 
best coding practices. Even though this version is improved in several
aspects it is still a pretty ugly code. So, don't teach yourself programming
with this game ;)
